  We got together over the Mindustry Discord to bring you this exotic mod. Adds in a few things we thought would be fun.
  [cyan]Update log:
    V6 update! Exotic will be going through massive changes as we fix up some things!
    Core: Nexus added!
    Hellfire is under rework, and currently has a placeholder sprite. 
    Core: Requiem. Have fun.
    Pew pew, the turrets do things now!
    [red]We really don't suggest using the Mod Factory or touching the Hellfire unit. 
    [black]youre welcome for the v2.4 hotfix.
